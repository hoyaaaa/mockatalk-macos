# Operations

## macSandbox Source Checkout

Use the local checkout instead of an installed macSandbox app:

```sh
cd /Users/hoya/macSandbox
git remote -v
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

The upstream repository is:

`https://github.com/yourtablecloth/macSandbox.git`

The PR page is:

`https://github.com/yourtablecloth/macSandbox/pulls`

Do not assume `/Applications/macSandbox for Windows.app` exists. It was removed because this project should use macSandbox as source/reference code, not as the product runtime.

## Current Manual Recovery Notes

The macSandbox virtio download previously hung during `Preparing virtio-win drivers...`.

Observed state:

- `curl` process ran for more than 8 hours
- TCP connection was `CLOSED`
- partial file stopped around 386 MB

Local fix applied:

- resumed and completed `virtio-win.iso`
- verified final size: `789645312`
- verified ISO label: `virtio-win-0.1.285`

Expected final file when the macSandbox app support directory exists:

`/Users/hoya/Library/Application Support/MacSandbox/drivers/virtio-win.iso`

## Checking macSandbox Baseline State

```sh
cat "/Users/hoya/Library/Application Support/MacSandbox/baseline/metadata.json"
ls -lh "/Users/hoya/Library/Application Support/MacSandbox/baseline"
```

Baseline is usable only when metadata status is `ready`.

## Build Or Run macSandbox From Source For Validation

```sh
cd /Users/hoya/macSandbox
swift build
.build/debug/MacSandbox
```

This is useful only for baseline creation and behavior validation. It is not the target product because macSandbox discards runtime changes.

If a temporary `.wsb` validation is needed, pass the config to the source-built executable:

```sh
cd /Users/hoya/macSandbox
.build/debug/MacSandbox /Users/hoya/Downloads/KakaoTalk-Windows/kakaotalk-macsandbox.wsb
```

## Prototype Commands To Derive

Future prototype should derive QEMU args from:

`/Users/hoya/macSandbox/src/MacSandbox/Core/QEMURuntime.swift`

Key needed behavior:

- persistent overlay instead of disposable overlay
- fixed app support path
- RDP host forward
- no `.wsb`
